# Object-Tracking-Pipeline

# ðŸŽ¯ Complete OWLv2 + SAM2 + Cutie Object Tracking Pipeline

This repository contains a **step-by-step Colab tutorial** for building a powerful **object tracking pipeline** using:

- **OWLv2** â€“ Text-based object detection  
- **SAM2** â€“ Pixel-perfect segmentation  
- **Cutie** â€“ Robust object tracking across frames  

## ðŸš€ Features
- Detect **any object** by text description (no training needed!)
- Generate **precise segmentation masks**
- Track objects seamlessly across video frames
- Works with **people, cars, animals, sports equipment**, and more
- Handles **occlusion, fast movement, and complex scenes**

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Run the following inside Google Colab:

```bash
!pip install -q transformers timm torchvision huggingface_hub pillow opencv-python matplotlib
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git
Cutie setup is handled automatically in the notebook.

ðŸŽ¬ Usage

Upload your video (either in Colab or Google Drive).

Update the video_path in the notebook:

video_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/your-video.mp4"

Change text_queries to detect your desired object(s):

text_queries = [["basketball", "ball"]]

Run the notebook to:

Detect objects

Create segmentation masks

Track objects frame by frame

Save the final tracked video (tracked_video.mp4)
